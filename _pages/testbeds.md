In addition to publishing research papers, I also contribute developing realistic testbeds and digital twins to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications. My work spans critical domains, including water treatment plants, chemical plants, and multi-robot swarm navigation and communication. These efforts aim to enhance system resilience, mitigate vulnerabilities, and close the sim-to-real gap in industrial control systems (ICS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS).
