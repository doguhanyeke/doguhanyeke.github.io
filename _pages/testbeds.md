In addition to publishing research papers, I contribute to the development of realistic testbeds and digital twins to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications. My work spans critical domains, including water treatment plants, chemical plants, and multi-robot swarm navigation and communication. These efforts focus on enhancing system resilience, mitigating vulnerabilities, and closing the sim-to-real gap in industrial control systems (ICS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS).
