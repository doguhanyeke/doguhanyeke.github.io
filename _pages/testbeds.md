In addition to publishing research papers, I focus on developing realistic testbeds and digital twins to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications. My work spans critical domains, including water treatment plants, chemical processing facilities, and multi-robot swarm navigation and communication. These efforts aim to enhance system resilience, improve operational efficiency, and close the sim-to-real gap in complex sociotechnical systems.
