<div class="testbed-intro">
In addition to publishing research papers, I contribute to the development of realistic testbeds and digital twins to bridge theoretical insights with practical applications. My work spans critical domains, including water treatment plants, chemical plants, and multi-robot swarm navigation and communication. These efforts focus on enhancing system resilience, mitigating vulnerabilities, and closing the sim-to-real gap in industrial control systems (ICS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS).

I led a collaborative project with Sandia National Labs to deploy and test cyber emulation tools on SOL4CE (Scalable Open Laboratory for Cyber Experimentation). Our team developed virtual environments for analyzing industrial control systems, focusing on two key case studies: a chemical plant simulator and manufacturing plants. We successfully identified and demonstrated critical vulnerabilities, including sensor spoofing attacks and control channel exploits. The project utilized Sceptre, a framework combining Minimega for VM orchestration and Phenix for configuration management. By implementing these testbeds in a controlled virtual environment, we enabled safe testing of security scenarios without risking physical infrastructure. This work advances our understanding of ICS vulnerabilities while providing a platform for future cybersecurity research and training.
