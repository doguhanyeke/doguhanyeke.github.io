  <b>CS 307: Software Engineering I (Undergraduate) [Fall 2023, Fall 2022]</b> [<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/academic-programs/courses/canonical/cs307.html" target="_blank">Syllabus</a>]<br/>
  This course introduces students to the issues in software development and the software life cycle, including models such as waterfall and spiral. It covers requirements and design specification, data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, finite state machines, and Petri-nets. Students learn about software testing (functional and structural), cost and effort estimation, and selected advanced topics such as reliability estimation, parallel program design, and verification methods. The course emphasizes the social implications of software quality and the relationship of software engineering to other disciplines.

  <b>CS 251: Data Structures (Undergraduate) [Spring 2022, Fall 2021]</b> [<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/academic-programs/courses/canonical/cs251.html" target="_blank">Syllabus</a>]<br/>
  This course covers the analysis and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Topics include running time analysis, abstract data types, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, binary trees, searching and sorting algorithms, heaps, binary search trees, balanced search trees, hashing, union-find structures, spatial data structures, tries, string algorithms, and an introduction to graphs and graph algorithms. Students gain experience with both theoretical and practical aspects of data structures, preparing them for advanced coursework and software development.
