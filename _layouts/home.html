I am a research assistant in Purdue University working on computer security and system security. 
My reserach focus is android, security and safety of automated systems, and deep learning applications in security. 
I received my M.S and B.S from METU, Computer Engineering department, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

Previously, I worked at Comodo, evaluating the malware classification. I also interned at SAP and eNTERFACE'17 when I was undergrad.
